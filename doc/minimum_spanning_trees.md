# Minimum Spanning Trees

## Reading

* [Minimum spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree).
* [Disjoint set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure).
* [Prim's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm).
* [Kruskal's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm).

## Exercise

* [Source codes](../tree/master/src/graph/span).
* [Unit tests](../tree/master/src/graph/span/test).

## Quiz

* Provide a graph example for which Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms generate different kinds of minimum spanning trees.  Explain how these trees are generated.  If you cannot find an example, explain why these algorithms always generate the same minimum spanning tree given any kind of graph.
* Write a report about your findings and save it as `quiz6.pdf`. Submit your report to: https://canvas.emory.edu/courses/32845/assignments/84125
