## Class

A class is a template to instantiate an object.
> What is the difference between "class" and "object"?

Let us create a new class called [`Numeral`](../src/main/java/edu/emory/cs/algebraic/Numeral.java) that we want to be a super class of all numeral types defined later:

```java
package edu.emory.cs.algebraic;

public class Numeral {

}
```

* `package`: indicates the name of the package (in a hierarchy) that this class belongs to.
* [Access-level modifiers](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/accesscontrol.html): `public`, `protected`, _no modifier_, `private`.
> What are the acceptable access-level modifiers to declare a top-level class?

Let us declare two methods, `add()` and `multiply()`, that are two operations expected for all numeral types:

```java
public class Numeral {
    /**
     * Adds `n` to this numeral.
     * @param n the numeral to be added.
     */
    public void add(Numeral n) { /* cannot be implemented */ }

    /**
     * Multiplies `n` to this numeral.
     * @param n the numeral to be multiplied.
     */
    public void multiply(Numeral n) { /* cannot be implemented */ }
}
```

* `@param`: adds a [javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/specs/javadoc/doc-comment-spec.html) comment about the parameter.

The problem is that we cannot define the methods unless we know what numeral type this class implements; in other words, it is too abstract to define those methods.
Thus, we need to declare `Numeral` as an abstract class type.
> What are the advantages of `Numeral` being an abstract class that becomes a super class of all numeral types?

There are two types of abstract classes in Java, `abstract class` and `interface`.
> Can an object be instantiated by an abstract class or an interface?


----
## Interface

Let us define `Numeral` as an [interface](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/createinterface.html):

```java
public interface Numeral {
    void add(Numeral n);
    void multiply(Numeral n);
}
```

* All methods in an interface have the access-level of `public` that does not need to be explicitly coded.
* Abstract methods in an interface are declared without their bodies.
> Who defines the bodies of these abstract methods?

Let us create a new interface called [`SignedNumeral`](../src/main/java/edu/emory/cs/algebraic/SignedNumeral.java) that inherits `Numeral` and adds two methods, `flipSing()` and `subtract()`:
> Can an interface inherit an abstract class or a regular class?

```java
public interface SignedNumeral extends Numeral {
    /** Flips the sign of this numeral. */
    void flipSign();

    /**
     * Subtracts `n` from this numeral.
     * @param n the numeral to be subtracted.
     */
    default void subtract(Numeral n) {
        n.flipSign();
        add(n);
        n.flipSign();
    }
}
```

* `extends`: inherits exactly one class or interface.
* `default`: allows an interface to define a [public method](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/defaultmethods.html) with its body (introduced in Java 8).
> Can we call `add()` that is an abstract method without a body in the default method `subtract()`?

Although the logic of `subtract()` seems to be correct, `n.flipSign()` gives a compile error because `n` is a type of `Numeral` that does not include the method `flipSign()`, which is defined in `SignedNumeral` that is a subclass of `Numeral`.
> What kind of a compile error does `n.flipSign()` give?

There are three ways of handling this error:
* [Casting](#casting)
* [Polymorphism](#polymorphism)
* [Generics](#generics)


----
## Casting

The first way is to downcast the type of `n` to `SignedNumeral`, which makes the compiler think that `n` has the method `flipSign()`:

```java
default void subtract(Numeral n) {
    ((SignedNumeral)n).flipSign();
    add(n);
    ((SignedNumeral)n).flipSign();
}
```

This removes the compile error; however, it will likely cause a worse kind of error called a [runtime error](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E51711_01/DR/Runtime_Error_Messages.html).
> Why is a runtime error worse than a compile error?

[Downcasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downcasting), although allowed in Java, is generally not recommended unless there is no other way of accomplishing the job without using it.
> How can downcasting cause a runtime error in the above case?


----
## Polymorphism

The second way is to change the type of `n` to `SignedNumeral` in the parameter setting:

```java
default void subtract(SignedNumeral n) {
    n.flipSign();
    add(n);
    n.flipSign();
}
```

This seems to solve the issue.
Then, what about `add()` and `multiply()` that are defined in `Numeral`?
Should we change their parameter types to `SignedNumeral` as well?

It is often the case that you do not have an access to change the code in a super class unless you are the author of it.
Even if you are the author, changing the code in a super class is not recommended.
> Why is it not recommended to change the code in a super class?

How about we override the `add()` method as follows?

```java
public interface SignedNumeral extends Numeral {
    @Override
    void add(SignedNumeral n);
    ...
}
```

* `@Override`: a predefined [annotation](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/predefined.html) type to indicate the method is overridden.

The annotation, `@Override`, gives an error in this case because it is not considered an [overriding](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/override.html).
> What are the criteria to override a method?

When the annotation is discarded, the error goes away and everything seems to be fine:

```java
public interface SignedNumeral extends Numeral {
    void add(SignedNumeral n);
    ...
}
```

However, this is considered an overloading, which defines two separate methods for `add()`, one taking `n` as `Numeral` and the other taking it as `SignedNumeral`.
Unfortunately, this would decrease the level of abstraction that we originally desired.
> What are good use cases of method overriding and overloading?


----
## Generics

The third way is to use [generics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/generics/), introduced in Java 5:

```java
public interface Numeral<T extends Numeral<T>> {
    void add(T n);
    void multiply(T n);
}
```

* `T`: is a generic type that is a subtype of `Numeral`. A generic type can be recursively defined as `T` extends `Numeral<T>`.
* Once defined, `T` is considered a legitimate type in this interface such that it can be used to declare `add()` and `multiply()`.
> Can we define more than one generic type per class (or interface)?

The generic type `T` can be defined in a subclass of `Numeral` as follows:

```java
public interface SignedNumeral extends Numeral<SignedNumeral> {
    void flipSign();

    default void subtract(SignedNumeral n) {
        n.flipSign();
        add(n);
        n.flipSign();
    }
}
```

* `T` is defined as `SignedNumeral` as in `Numeral<SignedNumeral>`.

This would implicitly update the parameter types of `add()` and `multiply()`:

```java
void add(SignedNumeral n);
void multiply(SignedNumeral n);
```

The issue is that the implementations of those methods may require specific features defined in the subclass, which are not available in `SignedNumeral`.
Let us consider the following subclass inheriting `SignedNumeral`:

```java
public class LongInteger implements SignedNumeral {
    @Override
    public void flipSign() { /* to be implemented */ }

    @Override
    public void add(SignedNumeral n) { /* to be implemented */ }

    @Override
    public void multiply(SignedNumeral n) { /* to be implemented */ }
}
```

* `implements`: inherits multiple interfaces.
* `LongInteger` is a regular class so that all abstract methods declared in the super classes must be defined here.


Since the parameters of `add()` and `multiply()` are typed to `SignedNumeral`, `n` cannot call any method defined in `LongInteger`, which leads to the same issue addressed in [casting](#casting).
> Would the type of `n` being `SignedNumeral` an issue for `subtract()` as well?

Thus, `SignedNumeral` needs to define its own generic type and pass it onto `Numeral`:

```java
public interface SignedNumeral<T extends SignedNumeral<T>> extends Numeral<T> {
    void flipSign();

    default void subtract(T n) {
        n.flipSign();
        add(n);
        n.flipSign();
    }
}
```

* `T` is a generic type inheriting `SignedNumeral`, that implies all subclasses of `SignedNumeral`.
* `T` can be safely passed onto `Numeral` because if it is a subclass of `SignedNumeral`, it must be a subclass of `Numeral`, which is how `T` is defined in `Numeral` (see the first example in this section).

Generics are used everywhere in Java; it is important to understand the core concept of generics and be able to adapt in your codes.


----
## Enum

Let us create an [enum](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html) class to represent the "sign":

```java
public enum Sign {
    POSITIVE,
    NEGATIVE;
}
```

* All items in an enum are have the [scope](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/classvars.html) of `static` and the access-level of `public`.
* Items must be delimited by `','` and ends with `';'`.

The items in the enum can be assigned with specific values that are more indicative (e.g., `+`, `-`):

```java
public enum Sign {
    POSITIVE('+'),
    NEGATIVE('-');

    private final char value;

    Sign(char value) {
        this.value = value;
    }

    /** @return the value of the corresponding item. */
    public char value() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

* `final`: makes this field a constant, not a [variable](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/variables.html), such that the value cannot be reassigned later.
* `this`: points to the [current](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/thiskey.html) object such that `this.value` is the member field of the corresponding object.
* `@return`: adds a [javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/14/docs/specs/javadoc/doc-comment-spec.html) comment about the return value of this method.
> Why should the member field `value` be `private` in the above example?

Note that `value` in the constructor (without `this`) indicates the local parameter whereas `value` in the `value()` method indicates the member field of the corresponding object.

----
## Interface Revisited

In `SignedNumeral`, it would be convenient to have a member field that indicates the sign of the numeral:

```java
public interface SignedNumeral<T extends SignedNumeral<T>> extends Numeral<T> {
    Sign sign = Sign.POSITIVE;
    ...
}
```

* All member fields of an interface are `static` and `public`.
> Can you declare a member field in an interface without assigning a value?

Given the `sign` field, it may seem intuitive to define `flipSign()` as a default method:
 
```java
/** Flips the sign of this numeral. */
default void flipSign() {
    sign = (sign == Sign.POSITIVE) ? Sign.NEGATIVE : Sign.POSITIVE;
}
```

* _condition_ `?` _A_ `:` _B_: a [ternary operator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/op2.html) that returns "A" if the condition is true; otherwise, returns "B".
> Are there any advantages of using a ternary operator instead of using a regular if statement?

Unfortunately, this gives a compile error because `sign` is a final field whose value cannot be reassigned.
In fact, an interface is not meant to define so many default methods, which were not even allowed before Java 8.
For such explicit implementations, it is better to define `SignedNumeral` as an abstract class instead of an interface.


----
## Abstract Class

Let us turn `SignedNumeral` into an [abstract class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/abstract.html):

```java
public abstract class SignedNumeral<T extends SignedNumeral<T>> implements Numeral<T> {
    protected Sign sign;

    public SignedNumeral() {
        this(Sign.POSITIVE);
    }

    public SignedNumeral(Sign sign) {
        this.sign = sign;
    }

    public void flipSign() {
        sign = (sign == Sign.POSITIVE) ? Sign.NEGATIVE : Sign.POSITIVE;
    }

    public void subtract(T n) {
        n.flipSign(); add(n); n.flipSign();
    }

    /**
     * Divides this numeral by `n`.
     * @param n the numeral to be divided.
     */
    public abstract void divide(T n);
}
```

* Unlike an interface, fields and methods in an abstract can be decorated by any modifiers that need to be explicitly coded.
* `protected`: allows subclasses of `SignedNumeral` and other classes in the `algebraic` package to directly access the field `sign`.
* Two [constructors](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/constructors.html) are overloaded, one with no parameter and the other with the parameter `sign`.
* `this(char)`: calls the second constructor in the current class.
* `abstract`: indicates that `divide()` is an abstract method.
> What is the advantage of calling `this(Sign.POSITIVE)` instead of stating `this.sign = Sign.POSITIVE`?

Thus, `SignedNumeral` has 3 abstract methods, `add()` & `multiply()` inherited from `Numeral` and `divide()` declared here.
> Can you define an abstract class or an interface without an abstract method?


----
## Regular Class

Let us define a regular class that inherits `SignedNumeral`:

```java
public class LongInteger extends SignedNumeral<LongInteger> {
    @Override
    public void divide(LongInteger n) {

    }

    @Override
    public void add(LongInteger n) {

    }

    @Override
    public void multiply(LongInteger n) {

    }
}
```
