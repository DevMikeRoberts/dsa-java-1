## Textbook

* [Data Structured and Algorithms in Java](https://emory.gitbook.io/dsa-java/) (2020 Edition) by Jinho D. Choi.


## Classes

* Students are expected to digest assigned lecture notes in the course webpage and prepare answers to the questions in the notes prior to each class.
* The actual classes will be driven by discussions and coding exercises with the aim of minimum lecturing on the materials that are already covered in the notes.
* All students are expected to join virtually during the regular class hours although all classes are recorded for those who reside in different time zones.
* It tremendously helps instructors interpret how students are doing when their faces are shown so please turn on the videos if you can during the classes.



## Grading

* 3 homework assignments: 30%
* 10 weekly quizzes: 70%
* No written exam


## Homework Assignments

* They aim to assess conceptual understanding, programming ability, and analytical writing skills.
* Each homework can be submitted anytime within 3 weeks from the assigned date.


## Weekly Quizzes

* They aim to check if students are keeping up with the weekly contents.
* Each quiz can be submitted anytime within 1 week from the assigned date.


## Notes

* Submissions must be original and handed in individually through GitHub.
